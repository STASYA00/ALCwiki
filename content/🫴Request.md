As implied by the name, a [request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) is a standardized message sent to an [[Endpoint]] _requesting_ to obtain some resources. An example could be a request to obtain all the movies' names from IMDB database.

üçèüçéüçä There are multiple types of requests. Some of them are:
* POST
* GET
* DELETE
* UPDATE
* OPTIONS
* PUT

The names suggest what we can achieve when sending these requests.üôÇ

The most common ones are **GET** and **POST**.

|                            request is visible -> less secure                             |                            request is invisible -> more secure                             |
|                           the data that can be sent is limited                           |                             larger amounts of data can be sent                             |
| same request -> same response *(is not supposed to change the state of the application)* | same request -> potentially different response *(can change the state of the application)* |
|                                  is used to _get_ data                                   |          is used to _send_ data and receive the result of the performed operation          |
|                          faster and more efficient, less secure                          |                slowlier, more secure, can send more data of different types                |

### üõ† How to

#### üêç Python

```
import requests

# GET request
r = requests.get("www.example.com/")
r = requests.get("www.example.com/message=mymessage")  # when sending a message as # a key-value pair with "message" as a key and "mymessage" as a value

# POST request
r = requests.post("www.example.com", data={"message": "my message"})
```
