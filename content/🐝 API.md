[API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) stands for Application Programming Interface. 

On conceptual level you can imagine an API as a canal lock connecting two bodies of water. An API allows two pieces of software to communicate with each other. As one would want to control the level of water in the channel, one would want to control the interaction between different parts of the software.

An API is usually made as a set of "methods" that are exposed as [[Endpoint]]s. A user (or a piece of software) can evoke these [[Endpoint]]s by sending a [[ü´¥Request]] to them (also known as _calling_ an endpoint).
