### 🚀 Getting started

Depending on your [[🪜 Level]] check the suggested [[🍗 Courses]] based on your area of interest. You can also [search]() for the topic of your interest, go through the [[Content]] or explore the [graph]().

### ⚒️ Tools

You don't need to have any tools (except for computer) to start programming:) But to make the experience more pleasant and the learning curve smoother we suggest:

* 📒 [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* 🧢  [VisualCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
* 🐍 [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) - how to [set it up](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/)
* 🐧 [WSL](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl)

This wiki is concentrating on [Python](https://www.python.org/) to be used as the main programming language. 

### 🕌 Coding in architectural software 

👀 Check out our guides on how to interact with architectural software via code:

* 🦏 [[Rhino]]
* 🏢 [[Revit]]
* 🎨 [[Adobe Suite]]
